# VoiceMode Demonstration Film

Production materials for VoiceMode screencast responding to Tiago Forte's article ["The Voice-Only Mid-Year Review: Testing the Limits of ChatGPT Voice Mode"](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-voice-only-mid-year-review-testing-the-limits-of-chatgpt-voice-mode/).

While Tiago found ChatGPT voice mode surprisingly good, it had limitations. This video shows how VoiceMode addresses those limitations and goes further.

## Core Message

**VoiceMode enables real work with an AI assistant - running programs, reading and writing files, building things - all without needing screen or keyboard. This is not just chat, this is hands-free software development and knowledge work.**

**Target Audience**: Knowledge workers, productivity enthusiasts, Tiago Forte's community

**Total Runtime**: ~5 minutes

**Filming Style**: Immersive POV using "follow shot" technique (camera follows from behind/over shoulder) - viewer experiences it as themselves, not watching someone else.

## Scenes

- Over-shoulder workspace shot

### 2. Dog Walking (30-40 sec)

### 5. Supermarket Shopping (40-50 sec)

### 6. Leaf Blowing (30-40 sec)

## What Makes This Different

This responds to Tiago Forte's disappointments with ChatGPT voice mode by showing:

- **Real work capability**: Not just chat - actual file operations, task creation, system integration
- **No time limits**: Local Whisper/Kokoro services (not cloud-constrained)
- **Privacy**: Local processing option
- **Noise handling**: Works in loud environments (leaf blower demo)
- **Visual analysis**: Can process images (store directory navigation)
- **Direct feedback**: No sycophancy - honest, challenging responses
- **True hands-free**: Works while driving, walking dog, operating equipment
